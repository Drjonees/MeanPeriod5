#### Name attributes of HTTP protocol makes it difficult to use for real time systems.

One of the core principles of the HTTP protocol, is the Request - Response model.
A client sends a request to the server and the server then comes with a appropriate response.
This is a great construction for a traditional website where the client do an action and gets a response back.
Since HTTP is stateless, every single request must have some information about what it want to do, where it should be done and who is doing it and so on.
All this information that needs to be send every time, adds up to alot of bytes which affects the speed of the request - response time.
